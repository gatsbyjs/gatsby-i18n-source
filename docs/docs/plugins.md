Gatsby plugins are Node.js packages that implement Gatsby APIs. For larger, more complex sites, plugins let you modularize your site customizations into site-specific plugins.

There are many types of Gatsby plugins, including data sourcing, SEO, responsive images, offline support, Sass support, sitemaps, RSS feeds, TypeScript, Google Analytics, and more. You can also [make your own plugins](/docs/creating-plugins/)!

Gatsby themes are a type of plugin that include a `gatsby-config.js` file and add **pre-configured** functionality, data sourcing, and/or UI code to Gatsby sites. To learn more about theme use cases and APIs, check out the [themes section of the docs](/docs/themes/).

Here are the guides in the Plugins section of the docs:
